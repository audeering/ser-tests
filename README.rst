=======================================
Speech Emotion Recognition Stress Tests
=======================================

Testing suite for speech emotion recognition models.

It provides a command line tool to test_
the models
for correctness,
fairness,
and robustness.
Results are grouped after the different model tasks:

* arousal_
* dominance_
* valence_
* `emotional categories`_


**ðŸš¨ Warning**:
you cannot install and run the test suite at the moment.
It depends on an internal Python package
to load all the models.
And most of the data used in the tests
is also hosted on internal servers.
The libraries for managing the data,
and applying the augmentations
are available as open-source.
