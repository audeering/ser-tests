=======================================
Speech Emotion Recognition Stress Tests
=======================================

Testing suite for speech emotion recognition models.

It provides a command line tool to test_
the models
for correctness,
fairness,
and robustness.

**Results**

* arousal_
* dominance_
* valence_
* `emotional categoris`_


**Usage**

We will open-source the required augmentation library,
and provide access to the data
and models
in the following months.
