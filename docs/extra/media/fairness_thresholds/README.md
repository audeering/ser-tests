## Fairness Thresholds

In order to set the thresholds for fairness tests, we simulate the behavior of a random model.
The simulation results are created with the script `random_model_simulation.py` and stored
in `simulation.csv`.

Corresponding plots are created with `plots.py` and stored in the `plots` subdirectory.
