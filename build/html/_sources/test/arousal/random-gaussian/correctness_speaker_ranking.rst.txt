Visualization
-------------

The plots visualize the precision of predicting speakers to be in the Top 25% or Bottom 25% of all speakers. Green dots indicate correctly classified speakers, red false positive speakers, whereby red squares indicate confusions between Top 25% and Bottom 25% speakers. The remaining grey data points are samples outside the range of interest. They contain false negatives that should have been predicted in the Top 25% or Bottom 25% of speakers, but were not. True negatives are those speakers that are not part of the Top 25% or Bottom 25%, and were predicted as such.
