    description: >
      The plot shows the proportion of the predicted samples
      for each class, as well as the true proportion of the
      class.
      We select a slightly higher threshold
      for the absolute error
      in the plots compared to the Class Proportion Difference
      test as we are interested
      in highlighting only big deviations here.
