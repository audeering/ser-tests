    description: >
      The plots visualize the precision
      of predicting speakers to be in the Top 25%
      or Bottom 25% of all speakers for each class
      in respect to the proportion of samples of
      that class.
      Green dots indicate correctly classified speakers,
      red false positive speakers,
      whereby red squares indicate confusions
      between Top 25% and Bottom 25% speakers.
      The remaining grey data points
      are samples outside the range of interest.
      They contain false negatives
      that should have been predicted in the Top 25% or Bottom 25% of speakers,
      but were not.
      True negatives are those speakers
      that are not part of the Top 25% or Bottom 25%,
      and were predicted as such.
