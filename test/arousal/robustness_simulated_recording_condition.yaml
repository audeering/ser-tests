    description: >
      Difference of predictions for audio with a baseline simulated
      position and audio with a different simulated position.
      The allowed prediction difference :math:`\delta < 0.05`
      is highlighted in green in the upper plot.
      The lower plot shows the distributions of the two predictions.
