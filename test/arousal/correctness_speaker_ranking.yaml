    description: >
      The plots visualize the precision
      of predicting speakers to be in the Top 25%
      or Bottom 25% of all speakers.
      Green dots indicate correctly classified speakers,
      red false positive speakers,
      whereby red squares indicate confusions
      between Top 25% and Bottom 25% speakers.
      The remaining grey data points
      are samples outside the range of interest.
      They contain false negatives
      that should have been predicted in the Top 25% or Bottom 25% of speakers,
      but were not.
      True negatives are those speakers
      that are not part of the Top 25% or Bottom 25%,
      and were predicted as such.
